# The Surviving Warriors
we developed a system through which we will crowdsource real time data about beds available in hospitals and predict chances of getting bed at the moment. Also we are connecting people who need plasma to Donors.

This Project was Developed by Team **Bonkers** during **NITS HACKS 4.0**

## Introduction
**Motive behind this project:**  Looking at the current scenario, where people are not able to get beds and they have to visit multiple hospitals to find beds and loose very precious time. And also no reliable source of Data is available in hour of rush as hospitals cannot update it frequently. our aim was to build something which can save that precious time spent in rushing form one hospital to another. also we see a lot of request on social media for plasma donors. so this was also another problem to solve.

**So what is "The Surviving Warrior" ?**
This App is Built for People who are tested Covid +ve , People who are yet to get Tested, Recovered people who are willing to donate Plasma and who need it.
* **For Covid +ve people.**
with a click you can access the list of all hospitals nearby with an indicator for ones chances of getting a bed.
* **For People yet to get Tested / ill.**
with just a click you can access the list of hospitals (in case of emergency).
* **For Plasma Donors.**
